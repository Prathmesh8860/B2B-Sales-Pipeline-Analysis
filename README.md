# 🚀 CRM Sales Opportunities Analysis (SQL + Excel)
---
Behind every sales opportunity, there’s a story waiting in the data.
In this project, I explored a CRM dataset capturing sales opportunities for a fictitious company selling computer hardware to large businesses.
The data included deals, sales teams, agents, industries, and products — and I analyzed it using SQL and a bit of Excel cleanup.

---
### 🔍 What I Set Out to Do :

Rather than just building queries, I wanted to answer the kinds of real CRM questions managers care about, such as:

1.Are our regional teams performing equally well?

2.Which agents are lagging and might need coaching?

3.What do quarter-over-quarter trends reveal about growth or risks?

4.Which products have the strongest opportunity-to-win conversion rates?

5.I ended up designing 15 business questions — a mix of recommended ones and new questions that surfaced during my exploration.

### 📊 A Few Highlights from the Analysis :

- Regional Performance: Central office closed the most revenue (~$4.07M), ahead of West (~$3.51M) and East (~$2.84M).

- Agent Performance Gaps: A handful of agents consistently closed fewer deals than the average.

- Quarterly Trends: Opportunity volumes peaked mid-2017, then dropped sharply in Q4 — signaling volatility.

- Winning Products: GTX Basic and MG Special were the most popular, with MG Special also converting at ~65%.

- Industries That Matter: Software and Technology sectors dominated account revenue, while Services lagged behind.

- Manager Insight: Summer Sewald oversaw the largest sales team (6 agents).

### 🧑‍💻 How I Approached It :

- Cleaned and formatted the CRM data in Excel.

- Wrote SQL queries to explore the dataset — joins, aggregations, ranking, and window functions for rolling averages and trend analysis.

- Matched each query with an output table to validate insights.

- Framed the findings in a way that sales managers could directly act on.

### 💡 Key Takeaways :

- CRM opportunities are uneven: certain teams, agents, and products carry most of the success.

- Conversion analysis shows product mix matters as much as total opportunities.

- Opportunity tracking should focus on trends and win rates, not just deal counts.

- SQL proved to be a powerful tool for turning CRM data into business intelligence.

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills in Action :

- SQL: joins, group by, ranking, aggregates, window functions (QoQ trends, rolling averages).

- Excel: cleaning raw data, fixing dates, formatting, quick validation.

- Business Lens: translating technical outputs into CRM sales strategy insights.
---
### 📌 Why This Matters :

CRM data is only as valuable as the insights it provides.
This project shows how even a simple CRM dataset can help managers track opportunities, benchmark performance, and identify gaps that need attention.
