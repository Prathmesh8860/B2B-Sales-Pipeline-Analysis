# 🚀 B2B Sales Pipeline Insights (SQL + Excel) 

When managing sales teams, numbers tell powerful stories.
In this project, I worked with a fictitious company that sells computer hardware to large businesses.
The dataset captured deals, sales teams, agents, industries, and products — and I decided to dig in using SQL and a bit of Excel cleanup.

### 🔍 What I Set Out to Do :

Instead of just crunching numbers, I wanted to answer the kinds of questions a sales manager would actually ask, like:

1.Are my teams hitting the mark?

2.Which agents are falling behind the pack?

3.Do our products convert consistently, or are a few carrying the weight?

4.How do revenues look when we stack quarters against each other?

5.I ended up with 15 business questions — some recommended at the start, and some that emerged naturally as I analyzed the data.

### 📊 A Few Highlights from the Analysis :

- Team Showdown: Central office led the way with $4.07M in annual revenue, beating West ($3.51M) and East ($2.84M).

- Who’s Struggling? Agents like Wilburn Farren and Rosalina Dieter closed noticeably fewer deals than their peers.

- Quarterly Rollercoaster: Deal volumes climbed sharply through 2017 Q2 and Q3, but then fell off a cliff in Q4.

- Product Spotlight: GTX Basic and MG Special were the crowd favorites — but MG Special also had the highest conversion rate (65%).

- Industry Leaders: Software and Technology dominated account revenues, while Services lagged far behind.

- Manager Insight: Summer Sewald managed the largest team (6 agents).

### 🧑‍💻 How I Approached It :

- Cleaned raw CSV data in Excel (fixing dates, removing noise, formatting).

- Wrote SQL queries to dig into the data — joins, aggregations, ranking, and a few window functions (like rolling 3-month averages).

- Each query came with an output table, making the results easy to interpret.

- Translated those numbers into insights that a sales manager could act on.

### 💡 Key Takeaways :

- Sales success is unevenly distributed: a few products and sectors drive the bulk of wins.

- Teams and agents aren’t equally strong — clear room for coaching and training.

- Performance tracking should go beyond totals; conversion rates and trend analysis reveal much more.

- SQL can do a lot more than answer homework-style questions — it can tell business stories.

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills in Action :

- SQL: joins, group by, aggregates, ranking, window functions, conversion metrics.

- Excel: cleaning data, formatting, quick checks.

- Business Thinking: framing technical results into performance insights.

### 📌 Why This Matters :

For any sales-driven organization, data visibility = performance improvement.
This analysis shows how a simple dataset can be transformed into a decision-making tool — helping managers see not just what happened, but also where to focus next.
